---Word Counter---
A simple web-based application that counts the number of words entered in a text area. The application is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
How it Works:
      -Type or paste text into the textarea.
      -Press the Count button to get the word count.
      -The total number of words is displayed below the textarea.
Technologies Used:
      -HTML: Structure of the page.
      -CSS: Basic styling (optional).
      -JavaScript: Core logic for word counting
HTML Structure:
      -A <textarea> for user input.
      -A <button> to trigger the word counting.
      -A <p> to display the word count result.
JavaScript Logic:
      -Retrieves the text from the <textarea>.
      -Splits the text into words using split(/\s+/) and counts them.
      -Handles edge cases like empty input or multiple spaces
